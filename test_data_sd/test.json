The overall spacing is manageable but requires some thoughtful movement."

      "estimate": "Hard",
      "reasoning": "Starting with two 'Sloper' holds for feet demands excellent body tension and friction management, making the initial moves challenging. While the handholds are mostly jugs, the spacing between them for the initial moves (especially from 'Jug' ID 20 to 'Jug' ID 22 and ID 19) appears to require significant reach. The traverse to 'Pocket' (ID 17) requires a controlled shift in body weight. This route emphasizes strong core engagement and sloper technique."
